// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a = 3
b = 5

a + b = 8

//In python ((and other langauges)) we could ask for the user to provide the numbers instead of setting them ourselves.

a = input("Value of the first number")
b = input ("value of the second number")

print (a + b)


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
// Request the user to give you a number
n = int(input("Please type in a number: "))

//Then use the modulo operator to see if there is a remainder left over
if n % 2 == 0:
    print ("Even")
else:
    print ("odd")


If (n % 2 == 0)
	print (“EVEN”)
Else 
print (“ODD”)

(Your pseudocode here)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

//Pseudo Code
a. prompt the user for 5 different integers

utilizing python I would use:

a = int(input ("Please input first interger: "))
b = int(input ("Please input second interger: "))
c = int(input ("Please input third interger: "))
d = int(input ("Please input fourth interger: "))
e = int(input ("Please input fifth interger: " ))

print( a, b, c, d, e,)


b. add the varaiables together and divide them by the number of varaiables to produce an average. Create a varaible to hold the sum of the intergers and then divide that varaible by 5.

sum = a + b + c + d + e 
average = sum / 5

print ("the average is: ", average)

c. I would use if/else statements to dictate logic to find the minimum and maxixmum numbers. I'm sure there is an easier and cleaner way of doing this!

if a < b:
    max = b
else:
    max = a
if c > max:
    max = c
if d > max:
    max = d
if e  > max:
    max = e

print ("The max number is: ", max) 

if a > b:
    min = b
else:
    min = a
if c < min:
    min = c
if d < min:
    min = d
if e < min:
    min = e
print (" The smallest number is: ", min)

D. I think I have already completed this step above. My full code tell's the user during each step of the processs.

a = int(input ("Please input first interger: "))
b = int(input ("Please input second interger: "))
c = int(input ("Please input third interger: "))
d = int(input ("Please input fourth interger: "))
e = int(input ("Please input fifth interger: " ))

print( a, b, c, d, e,)

sum = a + b + c + d + e 
average = sum / 5

print ("the average is: ", average)

if a < b:
    max = b
else:
    max = a
if c > max:
    max = c
if d > max:
    max = d
if e  > max:
    max = e

print ("The max number is: ", max) 

if a > b:
    min = b
else:
    min = a
if c < min:
    min = c
if d < min:
    min = d
if e < min:
    min = e
print (" The smallest number is: ", min)
